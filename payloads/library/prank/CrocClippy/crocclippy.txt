# Title: CrocClippy
# Description: Triggered when the user hits ENTER after a sudo or ssh command,
# sends a CTRL-C to cancel their command followed by drawing an ASCII Clippy
# that asks them if they want help with the command that we just blocked them from executing.
# Because that's what clippy is known for.
# Developed on a livestream shortly after the release of the KeyCroc
# Author: Korben, Darren, Chat
# Version: 1.0
# Category: Key Croc / Prank
