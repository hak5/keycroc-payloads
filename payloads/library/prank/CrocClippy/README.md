# CrocClippy

A very rude clippy experience in terminal, powered by the Key Croc

## Description: 

Triggered when the user hits ENTER after a sudo or ssh command,
sends a CTRL-C to cancel their command followed by drawing an ASCII Clippy
that asks them if they want help with the command that we just blocked them from executing.
Because that's what clippy is known for.
Developed on a livestream shortly after the release of the KeyCroc
